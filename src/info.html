    <h2>Strategy</h2>
    <p>
        There are 2 ways to play Connect 4, offensively or defensively. You can try to prevent all of your opponents attacks, blocking off 3 chains and 2 chains, or you can play aggressively, trying to connect your 4 pieces before the other player.
        If you are trying to play offensively, it is a good idea to set traps for your opponent. For instance, if they block off your one attack, you have another one lined up. Or if you have 2 connect 4 oportunities at the same time, the opponent has no choice but 
        to lose.
